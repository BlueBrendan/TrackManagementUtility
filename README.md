# Track Management Utility

## Preface
Track Management Utility is targeted at a narrow niche of music connoisseurs who care enough about music to store, manage, and organize their (digital) collection on a local hard disk. 
This description mostly applies to DJs, live performers, audiophiles, and serious hobbyists/enthusiasts â€“ people who are passionate enough for their craft to care about keeping a consistent tagging paradigm across their entire collection, which may consist of several thousand tracks or more that span across dozens of genres.

## Setup
1. Download the Track Management Utility folder from *mediafire link*
2. Run Track Management Utility.exe

Do not delete or tamper with any of the other files in the folder; they are required for Track Management Utility to run properly. You can create a shortcut of the .exe file on the Desktop for easier access.

## Overview
Track Management Utility scrapes tags from music stores/DJ pools Junodownload and Beatport, as well as the music database Discogs. The operation details can be found in the Track Management Utility Instructions PDF.

## Dependencies
Track Management Utility is written in Python and uses Tkinter, Python's standard out-of-the-box graphical interface. Dependencies include Mutagen for audio file handling/tag editing, Beautiful Soup for preliminary tag scraping from the web, Selenium for reverse image search, and Pillow for image handling.
